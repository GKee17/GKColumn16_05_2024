        <View style={{flexDirection:'row'}}> <Text style={{flex: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap'}}> Last week, the Prime Minister, and I, called university Vice Chancellors to a meeting 10 Downing Street to make it absolutely clear that they must crack down on antisemitism and ensure that protests do not unduly disrupt university life. It was a constructive meeting where we put clear steps in place to protect Jewish students on campus. </p> In the last year we’ve seen a 203% rise in antisemitic incidents at British universities. Whilst freedom of speech and the right to protest is vital to academic communities, this must not be used to intimidate students and staff and harm learning. </p> Last week, the Prime Minister, and I, invited university Vice Chancellors to a meeting 10 Downing Street to make it absolutely clear that they must crack down on antisemitism and ensure that protests do not unduly disrupt university life.

        Back in the constituency, it was fantastic as always to visit Chichester College last Friday who took delivery of 10,000 bricks donated by Persimmon Homes. The bricks, which are the equivalent to a 3 bedroom home, will be for construction students to hone their bricklaying skills. </p> I was lucky enough to watch Chichester College’s star student, Eric, demonstrate how it’s done before trying my hand at it with a little less success! Persimmon, who are developing some local housing projects, are working closely with the College to offer supplies and opportunities through apprenticeships for the students.   </p> This week I have had the privilege of hosting an event in Parliament to mark Dementia Action Week in collaboration with the team from Dementia Support at our wonderful local charity Sage House.   <p> Their model of care has proved a great success in Chichester, and they are now hoping to roll it out across the rest of the country. The event was a great opportunity to allow them to connect with my colleagues from all political parties in the House of Commons, as well as members of the House of Lords.  </p> I and many others have pledged to use our influence in Parliament to change the conversation around dementia and the support we give those who are living with this condition and their families. </a> .
